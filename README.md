# Credit Card Fraud Detection AI Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting fraud in credit card transactions. The project employs machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent and legitimate transactions. Below is an overview of the repository contents and instructions for use.

## Repository Contents

- **`notebook.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with the project's code and analysis.
- **`Docs EN - Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions.pdf`**: Project documentation in English.
- **`Docs ES - Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions.pdf`**: Project documentation in Spanish.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions. It utilizes various classification algorithms and performs comprehensive evaluation to determine the best approach for fraud detection.

## Notebook Contents

The Jupyter Notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) includes:

1. **Introduction to the Project**: Overview of the project and its objectives.
2. **Description of the Data Source**: Information about the source of the data used.
3. **Description of Data Preprocessing**: Details on data cleaning and transformation techniques.
4. **Graphs**:
   - Fraudulent/Legitimate
   - Box and Whisker
   - Heatmap
5. **Criteria for Evaluating the Data Mining Model**: Methods for assessing model performance.
6. **Execution of Different Machine Learning Methods**:
   - Naive Bayes (NB)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Decision Tree (DT)
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - AdaBoost (AB)
   - Majority Voting (MV)
   - Bagging (BG)
   - Random Forest (RF)
7. **Comparison and Conclusions**: Comparative analysis of methods and final conclusions.
